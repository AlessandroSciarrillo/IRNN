# IRNN
### Image Recognition Neural Network

## Overview
This is a school project. The system needs to be able to recognize images using a neural network.

## Goals
- [ ] ~~Image creation module which will be used to create suitable image for the program~~
- [x] Interface for statistic and usage of the program.
- [x] Neural network.

## Releases
None for now.

## Example usage
N/A
